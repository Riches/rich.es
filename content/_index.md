#### Random tech ramblings and other interesting things

I'm a web and tech enthusiast, and this is my personal site. I may blog about random things that I find interesting.

## About me

I currently live in Colchester, UK, with my partner Tania. I left my job in 2024 to work on my own projects, and
currently do contracting work as [NIXR](https://nixr.com).

I'm also working on a larger B2B SaaS project that I hope to release in 2025.

I'm a fan of open source software, but am yet to contribute as much as I would like. Although I'm a Linux fanboy we're
not yet living in the year of the Linux desktop.
